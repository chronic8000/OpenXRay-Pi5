  OpenXRay
</h1>

**OpenXRay** is an improved version of the X-Ray Engine, the game engine used in the world-famous S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game series by GSC Game World.

## Goals
1. Clean up engine code, boost performance, and fix original X-Ray Engine bugs that were polluting S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series.
2. Make it a drop-in replacement for original engine.
    1. Aim at 99% compatibility and same behaviour, where possible.
3. Support all three games in the series: SOC/CS/COP. (see [Supported game platforms](#supported-game-platforms) below)
4. Introduce a solid platform for modmakers:
    1. Add frame/render graph for those who want to add new graphics features.
    2. Add new scripting, development and debugging features.
    3. New game SDK with new features.
5. Enhance player's experience with new graphics, gameplay and other features that can be enabled optionally. (by default, we stay close to vanilla)

## Main differences from original X-Ray are:
- Support for 64-bit.
- Improved performance, better FPS.
- Original bugs fixes.
- New features for modmakers.
- Gamepad support. (not yet finished, but you can try already, see [#943](https://github.com/OpenXRay/xray-16/issues/943))
- Works on Linux, macOS, *BSDs and supports ARM, ARM64, E2K (Elbrus 2000), PPC64LE architectures.

You can see the detailed differences table [here](https://github.com/OpenXRay/xray-16/wiki/%5BEN%5D-Differences-from-original-X‐Ray)

## Supported game platforms
OpenXRay is based on X-Ray 1.6.02, used in S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat, but the engine was extended to support more than that:

|Call of Pripyat|Clear Sky|Shadow of Chernobyl|Call of Chernobyl|
|---|---|---|---|
|Yes|Release candidate (see [#382](https://github.com/OpenXRay/xray-16/issues/382)).<br>Minor bugs possible, but game is stable finishable.| **Not supported** yet (see [#392](https://github.com/OpenXRay/xray-16/issues/392))|Yes|

Join our efforts in making our beloved game better, send pull requests, participate in discussions and code reviews!

It is a place to share ideas on what to implement, gather people that want to work on the engine, and work on the source code. However, the following things should be taken into consideration:
* We want to keep the game close to the vanilla, so if you want to introduce new gameplay features, make sure it is optional, and doesn't break compatibility with original game resources (i.e. everything in `gamedata` folder and `.db*`/`.xdb` archives). You also may want to add non-gameplay features, fix bugs, or improve engine performance and code quality.
* Major changes should be discussed before implementation.

Take a look at our [Issues](https://github.com/openxray/xray-16/issues) page:
* See issues labeled as [good first issue](https://github.com/OpenXRay/xray-16/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22Good+first+issue%22) to get familiar with the engine code in practice.
* You may also want to look at issues labeled as [help wanted](https://github.com/OpenXRay/xray-16/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22Help+wanted%22). Some of them are difficult ones, though.

The `dev` branch is the default and base branch for the project. It is used for development, and all pull requests should go there. But be aware that this branch sometimes may be broken, and we can only rarely do force pushes to this branch.

Be advised that this is a community project not sanctioned by GSC Game World in any way – and they remain the copyright holders
of all the original source code and S.T.A.L.K.E.R. franchise. However, they know about many community projects, including this, and support the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. community efforts to make the game better.
